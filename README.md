# 💧 Groundwater Level Prediction using LSTM
GroundWaterlevelPrediction Description

8 Strong & Simple Insights
🔹 1. Seasonal Groundwater Change

What happened:
Groundwater levels go down in summer and increase after monsoon.

Why it matters:
This shows groundwater is strongly affected by season and rainfall.

🔹 2. Overall Groundwater Decrease

What happened:
Even after good rainfall, groundwater levels slowly decrease over the years.

Why it matters:
It warns us about overuse of groundwater and future water shortage risks.

🔹 3. Past Levels Influence Future

What happened:
Current groundwater levels depend heavily on previous months’ data.

Why it matters:
This proves LSTM is suitable because it learns from past data patterns.

🔹 4. Rainfall Recharge with Delay

What happened:
Groundwater levels increase after rainfall, but not immediately.

Why it matters:
Groundwater needs time to recharge, so time-based models are important.

🔹 5. High Water Usage Slows Recovery

What happened:
Areas with more water usage recover slowly, even when rainfall is good.

Why it matters:
Human activity plays a major role in lowering groundwater levels.

🔹 6. LSTM Prediction Stability

What happened:
The LSTM model gave smooth and stable predictions over time.

Why it matters:
Stable predictions are more reliable for long-term water planning.

🔹 7. Early Low-Water Warning

What happened:
The model can predict low groundwater levels in advance.

Why it matters:
Early prediction helps take preventive action before problems occur.

🔹 8. Support for Sustainable Water Management

What happened:
Model results clearly show when groundwater usage becomes unsafe.

Why it matters:
This supports better planning and sustainable groundwater management.
